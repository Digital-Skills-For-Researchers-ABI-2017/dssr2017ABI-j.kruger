# Vision

Two thirds of women will suffer from urinary incontinence (involuntary leakage of urine) during their lifetime. For most there are simple solutions, including pelvic floor muscle training. However, many women are unaware or unable to effectively contract their pelvic floor muscles and adherence to PFMT is poor.

# Mission

We have developed a novel wearable intra-vaginal pressure sensing device that transmits data in real time to a smart phone. The app is able to indicate when the exercises have been performed correctly, track progress over time, encourage participation and (if desired) connect to a health care provider to monitor changes over time. 

# Success Criteria

clinical validation of the device is critical. Does the information from the pressure sensors concur with other instruments that currently measure sucess of a PFMT programme?  Is there resolution of the symptoms? Is the device easy to use, does it meet the other requirements required for sucess, both in a clinical setting and (eventually) in a consumer setting?

# Team Agreement

This is a multidisciplinary team, including urogynaecologists, physiotherapists, bioengineers (students and PI's) and app developers.  Open communication is essential for advancement of the project.
