synopsis

The pelvic floor research group is focused on developing a better understanding of pelvic floor muscle function and dysfunction in women. 
\
We have several projects including computational modeling of the second stage of labour, design and development of novel bio instrumentation and the use of these instruments in clinical studies. A substantial part of the research focus is on risk assessment for pelvic floor dysfunction, prevention and treatment for pelvic floor disorders including urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse.
