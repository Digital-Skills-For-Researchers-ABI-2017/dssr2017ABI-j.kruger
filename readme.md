#synopsis


The pelvic floor research group is focused on developing a better understanding of pelvic floor muscle function and dysfunction in women. 

We have several projects including computational modeling of the second stage of labour, design and development of novel bio instrumentation and the use of these instruments in clinical studies. A substantial part of the research focus is on risk assessment for pelvic floor dysfunction, prevention and treatment for pelvic floor disorders including urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse. 

#Motivation

The prevalence of pelvic floor muscle dysfunction in women is enormous.  One in four women will suffer from one or more pelvic floor disorders during their life time. Our understanding of the mechanics of how these disorders develop is limited and most of our knowledge has been been gained from large epidemiological studies. These are expensive, time consuming and result in statistical associations between variables, not an understanding of the mechanics involved.

We will develop a
